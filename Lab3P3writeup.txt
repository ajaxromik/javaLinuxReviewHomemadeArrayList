The compareTo method seems to indicate something like the difference in
ASCII values, or something similar(i'm not familiar with the exact values
so i cannot say for sure).

On strings that are the same up until a point where one string is shorter
than the other, the string that is shorter would evaluate a compareTo()
method on the longer string to be a negative integer. The opposite direction
changes the signs.

Otherwise, each character in the string is evaluated against the character in
the opposite string, and it returns something similar to a difference in ASCII
codes.
